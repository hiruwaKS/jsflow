# Troubleshooting

## Limitations

- **Path Explosion**: Complex programs with many branches may generate exponential execution paths. Use `-s` (single branch) or `-1` (coarse) modes to mitigate.

- **Dynamic Features**: Highly dynamic JavaScript code (heavy use of `eval`, dynamic property access, complex prototypes) may not be fully analyzed.

- **False Positives**: Some detected paths may not be exploitable in practice due to:
  - Runtime checks not visible in static analysis
  - Sanitization that isn't recognized
  - Context-specific constraints

- **False Negatives**: Some vulnerabilities may be missed due to:
  - Complex control flow
  - Dynamic code generation
  - Unmodeled library functions

- **Performance**: Large codebases may require significant analysis time. Consider:
  - Using `-s` for initial scans
  - Setting function timeouts with `-f`
  - Limiting call depth with `-c`

- **Constraint Solving**: The Z3 solver has a timeout (default 2000ms). Complex constraint systems may timeout, resulting in "failed" path analysis.

## Common Issues

### 1. "Module not found" errors

Ensure npm dependencies are installed:
```bash
cd esprima-csv && npm install && cd ..
```

### 2. Z3 solver timeouts

Increase timeout in `solver.py` or use `-1` for coarse analysis.

### 3. Memory issues

Use `-s` (single branch) mode or reduce `-c` (call limit).

### 4. No vulnerabilities found

Try:
- Different vulnerability types (`-t`)
- Module mode (`-m`) if analyzing npm packages
- Check that sources and sinks are properly modeled

### 5. Analysis hangs

Set function timeout with `-f` flag.

## Debugging

Enable verbose logging by checking `logs/*/graph_log.log` for detailed graph construction information.
