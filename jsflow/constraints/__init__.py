Constraint Engine - Expression IR and Z3 encoding for exploit generation.

This package provides a modern constraint solving system built on an
intermediate representation (IR) of expressions and conditions. It offers
a clean separation between building expressions from graph edges, encoding
to Z3 constraints, and solving for exploit values.

Typical Usage:
--------------
    from jsflow.constraints import build_expressions, encode_to_z3
    exprs = build_expressions(G, target_obj_ids)
    for target, expr in exprs.items():
        solver = z3.Solver()
        term = encode_to_z3(expr, solver)
        solver.add(z3.Contains(term, z3.StringVal("payload")))
        if solver.check() == z3.sat:
            print("Exploit:", solver.model())

The builder walks CONTRIBUTES_TO edges backward from sink objects, groups
operands using the recorded operation tuple (op, group-id, index), and
produces an expression DAG. The encoder then translates that DAG into z3 terms
with reasonable fallbacks for unknown operations.

Expression Types:
-----------------
- ConstString/ConstNumber: Literal values
- Symbol: Graph node variables (to be solved)
- Concat/Add/Sub: String/numeric operations
- Choice: Multiple possible values (from branches)
- UnknownOp: Unrecognized operations (treated as fresh variables)

Condition Types:
----------------
- Predicate: Atomic comparison (eq, contains, lt, etc.)
- AndCondition/OrCondition: Logical combinators
- NotCondition: Logical negation
- PathConstraint: Expression + path condition pair
